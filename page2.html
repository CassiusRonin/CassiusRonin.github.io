    <p>The Transformers (Cybertronus cybertronii) are a species of sentient, living robotic beings (mostly) originating from the distant machine world of Cybertron. The stories of their lives, their histories, and most especially their wars have been chronicled across many different continuities in the vast multiverse.</p>
    <p>While this species is commonly known throughout the galaxy as "Transformers", the technical term for these beings is Cybertronians, which they generally use to refer to themselves. Other, less-frequently used terms to refer to beings from Cybertron include Cybertronic or simply Cybertron.</p>
